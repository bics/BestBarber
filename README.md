# UX

# Features

## Existing features

### Navigation bar
The navigation bar is positioned and fixed at the top of the pages.\
Styling is consistent across all pages. However on smaller devices the nevigation bar takes up the full width of the screen, as we go to larger screens above tablet size it's size only takes a fraction (30 percent) of the screen and receives a shadow around to highlight it's position.\
It helps navigate through all main pages, namely Home, Gallery and Contact Us.

### Footer
The footer element is positioned and fixed at the bottom of the pages.\
Styling is consistent across all pages. However on smaller devices the footer takes up the full width of the screen, as we go to larger screens above tablet size it's size only takes a fraction (30 percent) of the screen and receives a shadow around to highlight it's position.\
The element provides links to social media platforms, namely in order Facebook, X, Google and Github.

### Landing page 

* #### Description

This element provides an overview of the company itself, and also includes the services provided by the establishment to it's users.

* #### Employee introduction

This section provides an overview of the staff.\
All staff member currently employed is presented with a background and a little bit of personal touch.

### Gallery page

* #### Gallery section

This section purpose is to showcase the services, and provide pointers to future customers.\
Images all have the same sizes, and styled to properly fit on all devices. On smaller devices these are achived by simply showing one column of pictures. As we increase the screen size
on tablet sizes, we will see the two columns. On the largest screen sizes four columns are shown.\
Spacing between images on smaller (phones and tablets) screens will be minimal to save space. On larger screens a more spacious grid appears to separate each image.

### Contact Us page

* #### Contact section
This is the section were the users can interact with the site.\
As mentioned before users might be tempted to make an appointment. This section shows the currently employed barbers, and both their picture and name will bring up a form to request an 
appointment. \
The form appears on the screen as a modal in the center of the screen.\
Below the employees is a link to open the form but instead of an appointment the users can submit a question.\
\
The form itself as previously stated is a modal to ensure a dynamic flow of interaction. The form itself in all cases have a required "Name" and "Email" input.\
Depending on the action chosen (appointment or general question), a date picker and employee selector is present for appointments and a text area is present for the other case. All fields are required to submit the form on their respective action.\
\
Once the form is submitted a confirmation is shown to inform the user.

# Testing

## Manual testing

### Contact (contact-us.html) page

Form testing:

devtools - "An invalid form control with name='' is not focusable."
add type="button"
mentioned https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22148080/an-invalid-form-control-with-name-is-not-focusable

## Automated testing

Used [W3C](https://www.w3.org) validator for both [html](https://validator.w3.org) and [css](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validation.
Used [Jshint](https://jshint.com) for javascript validation

### HTML validation

Main (index.html) page testing:
* During validation only 1 warning was flagged
    * Introduction section was lacking a heading element
    
Steps taken:
1. Added a heading element with a class attribute "hidden-heading".

Gallery (gallery.html) page testing:
* During validation only 1 warning was flagged
    * Gallery section was lacking a heading element

Steps taken:
1. Added a heading element with a class attribute "hidden-heading". These classes meant to be hidden, updated the display property in css to the value "none".


Contact (contact-us.html) page testing:
* During validation 7 errors were present
    * Form on page didn't have an action.
    * Two div element was present with the same id, "name-input"
    * Script tags was marked as stray, as it was outside both the header and body element.
    * Bad value Cesarina Polyphonte for attribute id on element a: An ID must not contain whitespace.
    * Bad value Patr√≠cia Odelia for attribute id on element a: An ID must not contain whitespace.
    * Bad value Heimdallr Hermokrates for attribute id on element a: An ID must not contain whitespace.
    * A select element with a required attribute, and without a multiple attribute, and without a size attribute whose value is greater than 1, must have a child option element.

Steps taken:
1. Filled action value of form with the method "Post"
2. Renamed the id of the email input container.
3. Simply replaced script tags to be inside the body element.
4. Ids were corrected, and updated scripts to reformat names.
5. Removed "required" attribute from select element, and readding attribute inside script.

After these errors were corrected there were no more errors or warnings.

### CSS validation 

Style (style.css) testing:
* During validation there were no errors present

A couple warning were given for "-webkit-animation-name" and "-webkit-animation-duration". As this is a code not written by me, I choose to ignore these warnings.

### JS validation

Contact (contact-us.js) testing:
* During validation the following warnings were present:
    * Line 6, Column 73: Missing semicolon.
    * Line 8, Column 70: Missing semicolon.
    * Line 14, Column 71: Missing semicolon.
    * Line 17, Column 72: Missing semicolon.
    * Multiple instances of the following warnings
        * 35	'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
        * 109	'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
    * Line 83, Column 9: Confusing use of '!'.

Steps taken:
1. Semicolons added to line ends.
2. Decided to ignore the "'let'/'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)" warnings as the scripts working as intended on all tested browsers including Mozilla.
3. Removed negative if statement, should have been consistent as the other validation methods return true by default.
